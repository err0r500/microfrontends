## Demo

## Test the app
```bash
git clone git@github.com:err0r500/microfrontends.git
cd microfrontends
npm install
npm run start
```

## Motivation
Elm is a quite powerful language when dealing with data complexity. Unfortunately not many frontend developers are comfortable with it.

Webcomponents allow different teams to build dumb components (display data, emmit events, style) in the framework they prefer and ship them as webcomponents. 

Elm only is used to integrate all the components together.
