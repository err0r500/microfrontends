# Microfrontends with Elm and webcomponents

## Test the app
```bash
git clone git@github.com:err0r500/microfrontends.git
cd microfrontends
npm install
npm run start
```

## Motivation
Elm is a quite powerful language when dealing with data complexity. Unfortunately not much frontend developers are comfortable with it.
